## Documentation

### Archiving

To help maintain this project and in the spirit of aiding future developers, the HTML of the movie player and the bottom element will be archived periodically.

### Maintenance

This was built with long-term maintenance in mind. Unlike other solutions, this does not rely on JavaScript and **should continue to work** after YouTube removes the old player entirely. All assets are locally stored to avoid external dependencies.

## Background

In 2025, YouTube began A/B testing new designs for their player. In October, YouTube began a [full rollout](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/380540176) with no option to revert.

## Credit

- Archiving formatter: [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/html)
- [Control Panel for YouTube](https://soitis.dev/control-panel-for-youtube) for enabling temporary access to the old player
